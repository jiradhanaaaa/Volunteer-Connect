# VolCon: Volunteer Connect

## Introduction
VolCon (*Volunteer Connect*) is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between volunteers and nonprofit organizations in Indonesia. With over 269,000 active volunteers and more than 21,000 registered organizations, the need for a centralized, user-friendly platform to connect both parties has become crucial. VolCon addresses this issue by streamlining the process of discovering and registering for volunteer opportunities while aiding organizations in managing events effectively.

## Features
- **Volunteer Opportunities Directory:** A centralized database for browsing various nonprofit activities.
- **Efficient Registration System:** Simplified process for volunteers to join and manage events.
- **Organization Dashboard:** Tools for nonprofits to post, manage, and track their events.
- **Responsive Design:** Accessibility across different devices.

## Development Approach
### Methodology: Design Thinking
To ensure user-centered design and functionality, VolConâ€™s development followed the five phases of Design Thinking:
1. **Empathize:** Conducted interviews and surveys with volunteers and organizations to understand their needs.
2. **Define:** Synthesized insights using affinity mapping and formulated problem statements with "How Might We" solutions.
3. **Ideate:** Brainstormed ideas, benchmarked similar platforms, and designed user flows for intuitive navigation.
4. **Prototype:** Created low-fidelity prototypes for initial feedback, followed by high-fidelity designs tested for accessibility, including color blindness testing.
5. **Test:** Conducted usability testing using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and evaluated results using statistical analysis (T-Test).

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with responsive frameworks).
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js.
- **Database:** MongoDB for scalable data storage.
- **Design Tools:** Figma for prototyping and design.

## Evaluation and Results
### System Usability Scale (SUS)
- **Initial Test:** Score of 71, indicating room for improvement.
- **Post-Redesign Test:** Score of 88.25, demonstrating a significant improvement of 17.25 points.

### Statistical Analysis: T-Test
- **Outcome:** T-test confirmed a statistically significant improvement in usability metrics, with reduced standard deviation and error.

## Limitations
1. **Limited Sample Size:** Feedback was collected from a small, non-representative sample.
2. **Focus on Usability:** Less emphasis on backend scalability and advanced features.
3. **Sampling Technique:** Accidental sampling limited the generalizability of findings.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate advanced filters for volunteer opportunities.
- Develop mobile applications for broader accessibility.
- Add analytics for organizations to track volunteer engagement.
